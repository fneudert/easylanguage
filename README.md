# EasyLanguage code for TradeStation

## How it started

I started recently seriously playing around with TradeStation. First thing I found out was, that Order entry can be difficult, especially for new traders like me. I have to do more trendlines and calculations than an experienced trader and it also takes more time to calculate all necessary values. When I'm finally fine to do the trade, I have to enter an OSO/OCO trade combination with an amount of shares, entry stop and limit, stoploss and target. At the time I was finished and ready to submit, the  trade is already gone. Most frustrating, when it went as I expected, but it took too long to analyze and calculate. 

So I came up with an idea of an assistant, which helps to calculate and submit the order. 

## About this Repo

Assuming that I'm not the only one dealing with those problems, I decided to share my code with the world. It's not perfect, some behaviour is weird and I don't know if this is because of the platform or I'm just missing something. 

The code is published under the current GPL license and it is as it is, no warranty, no promises.

I will add code as I create it, and normally it will become better over time with more experience. 

## Usage of the files

The code is in ELD files, looks like an proprietary binary format, which can be imported into TradeStation Development Environment.

## Finally ...

If you like this stuff and you get something out of it, may it be knowledge, ideas, money or whatever, [feel free to buy me a beer or a coffee :-)](https://paypal.me/fneudert)

Have a nice day and good luck
